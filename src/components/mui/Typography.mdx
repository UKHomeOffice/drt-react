# Type Specimens
## Title text
In the type scale, headlines span from a range of 1 through 6. Headlines are the largest text on the screen, reserved for short, important text or numerals.

## Subtitle text
Subtitles are smaller than headlines. They are typically reserved for medium-emphasis text that is shorter in length.

## Body text
Body text comes in ranges 1-2, and itâ€™s typically used for long-form writing as it works well for small text sizes.

## Caption & Overline text
Caption and overline text (text with a line above it) are the smallest font sizes. They are used sparingly to annotate imagery or to introduce a headline.
