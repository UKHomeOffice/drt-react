# MUI Theme Reference

This is the theme object returned from mui's [useTheme()](https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/theming/#accessing-the-theme-in-a-component) component hook.

**NOTE:** This only displays theme variables, and does not document any theme helper function, such as [theme.spacing()](https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/spacing/) or [breakpoint media queries](https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/spacing/).
