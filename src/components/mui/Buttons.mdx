### Basic button
The Button comes in two variants: text (default) and contained. In this theme, Mui outlined buttons have been overriden to match contained..

### Text buttons
Text buttons are typically used for less-pronounced actions, including those located: in dialogs, in cards. In cards, text buttons help maintain an emphasis on card content.
