# Buttons

### Basic button
The Button comes with three variants: text (default), contained, and outlined.

### Text buttons
Text buttons are typically used for less-pronounced actions, including those located: in dialogs, in cards. In cards, text buttons help maintain an emphasis on card content.

### Contained buttons
Contained buttons are high-emphasis, distinguished by their use of elevation and fill. They contain actions that are primary to your app.

### Outlined buttons
Outlined buttons are medium-emphasis buttons. They contain actions that are important but aren't the primary action in an app.

Outlined buttons are also a lower emphasis alternative to contained buttons, or a higher emphasis alternative to text buttons.
